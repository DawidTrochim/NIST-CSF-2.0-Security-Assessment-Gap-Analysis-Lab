# Assessment Assumptions

1. This is a synthetic engagement; all names, systems, and evidence are fictionalized.
2. Assessment period assumes a 4-week evidence collection window.
3. Scope includes enterprise IT, customer portal environment, and key third-party dependencies.
4. OT/industrial control systems are out of scope.
5. Limited SOC staffing means after-hours monitoring is best-effort unless escalated.
6. Budget and headcount increases are possible but constrained; roadmap emphasizes phased, practical uplift.
7. Regulatory context is driven primarily by contractual obligations and UK data protection expectations.
8. Existing tooling footprint is retained where possible; recommendations favor process maturity and configuration hardening before major platform replacement.
