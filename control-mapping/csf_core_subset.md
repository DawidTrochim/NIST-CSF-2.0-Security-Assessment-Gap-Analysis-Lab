|---|---|---|
| GV-1 | Cybersecurity governance charter | Board-approved charter defines security accountability and oversight cadence. |
| GV-2 | Policy framework lifecycle | Core policies are documented, version-controlled, and reviewed annually. |
| GV-3 | Roles and responsibilities | Security responsibilities are assigned across IT, operations, HR, and leadership. |
| GV-4 | Risk management process | Formal process exists to identify, rate, treat, and track cyber risk. |
| GV-5 | Third-party risk governance | Supplier security requirements and due diligence are defined and tracked. |

## Identify (ID)
| Outcome ID | Outcome Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ID-1 | Asset inventory completeness | Hardware, software, cloud, and data assets are inventoried and owned. |
| ID-2 | Business criticality and data classification | Assets and data are classified by criticality and sensitivity. |
| ID-3 | Network and data flow visibility | Key system interactions and trust boundaries are documented. |
| ID-4 | Vulnerability management process | Vulnerability scanning, triage, and remediation SLAs are established. |
| ID-5 | Threat-informed risk assessment | Threat scenarios are regularly used to refine risk priorities. |

## Protect (PR)
| Outcome ID | Outcome Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| PR-1 | Identity and access management baseline | Joiner/mover/leaver process with least privilege and periodic access review. |
| PR-2 | MFA coverage | MFA enforced for administrators, remote access, and high-risk applications. |
| PR-3 | Endpoint hardening and EDR | Endpoint configuration baseline and EDR coverage for servers/workstations. |
| PR-4 | Patch and configuration management | Critical patching and secure baseline configuration are operationalized. |
| PR-5 | Data protection controls | Encryption, retention, DLP, and backup controls protect sensitive data. |
| PR-6 | Security awareness program | Users receive role-based awareness training and phishing simulations. |
| PR-7 | Secure software and cloud configuration | Customer portal and cloud resources follow secure build and change controls. |

## Detect (DE)
| Outcome ID | Outcome Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| DE-1 | Centralized logging | Security logs from core systems are centrally retained and searchable. |
| DE-2 | Detection use cases | Alerts for common attack patterns are defined and tuned. |
| DE-3 | Monitoring coverage for critical assets | Monitoring includes portal, identity, endpoints, and privileged activity. |
| DE-4 | Alert triage workflow | Alert handling workflow exists with severity model and response targets. |
| DE-5 | Anomaly detection and baselining | Baselines exist for normal user/admin/system behavior. |

## Respond (RS)
| Outcome ID | Outcome Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| RS-1 | Incident response plan | IR plan exists with defined phases, roles, and escalation path. |
| RS-2 | Incident classification and playbooks | Playbooks cover phishing, ransomware, credential abuse, and portal compromise. |
| RS-3 | Internal and external communications | Communications process supports legal, customers, regulators, and suppliers. |
| RS-4 | Forensic readiness | Logs, retention, and evidence handling support investigations. |
| RS-5 | Lessons learned process | Post-incident reviews feed policy and control improvements. |

## Recover (RC)
| Outcome ID | Outcome Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| RC-1 | Backup and restore testing | Backups are protected, monitored, and routinely restore-tested. |
| RC-2 | Business continuity and disaster recovery integration | Cyber scenarios are integrated into BC/DR plans and exercises. |
| RC-3 | Recovery communications and service restoration priorities | Recovery sequencing and stakeholder communications are predefined. |
| RC-4 | Improvement tracking after disruption | Recovery gaps are tracked to closure with owners and deadlines. |
